----INSTRUCTIONS----

This mod now comes with several different .pak files.

The PlayableCat one is the one you need to install to play as a cat. Simply drag this into your mods folder for it to work. But please keep in mind that you will need a Race Extender mod to play as a cat! (I personally use the One Race Extender, even though it says it's only for nightly/unstable)

----BONUS MOD INFO----

The p_petsaddon.pak is for anyone who is playing with Purchasable Pets (like me) but who still wants a RolliePollie (or rolypoly, but I called these rolliepollie to make them different from the rolypoly critter already in the game) as a pet. (I actually had to make this just to test the pet, haha. So I figured I might as well package them together.)

You WILL need the Purchasable Pets mod for this to work. Find this here:

If you do not have purchasable pets, do not worry about this file. Your rolliepollie will show up on your ship when you start your game. 


There is also another optional .pak file in here that SHOULD replace the bicolor cats with Siamese, instead. Just place it in your mods folder, and the game should do the rest. :)

I have also included a temporary SAIL fix, so that people who prefer playing with S.A.I.L changers can continue doing so while using this mod. This unfortunately changes the cattechstation to a hylotl one, meaning you lose the custom pet. Nothing else I can do unless the sail changing mods add cats to their assets. :/

----BUGS, ERRORS AND FEEDBACK----

If you find any errors in either of these files, please head to this URL and post them:

Thanks for downloading and playing! If you enjoy my mods, do let me know.
